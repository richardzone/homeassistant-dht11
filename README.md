# Home Assistant DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor

**This is a spin-off from the official home assitant DHT integration, which was removed since Home Assistant Core version 2022.4.0.**

The `dht` sensor platform allows you to get the current temperature and humidity from a DHT11 device.

**This is for DHT11 only.**
